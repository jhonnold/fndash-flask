# Fortnite Dashboard

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ezM16Lp.png)

This is a simple fortnite dashboard designed to allow a select group of people quick access to all their stats. We track all the standard statistics that are avaialable to us (kills/placements/matches), and also generate stats on a *game* to *game* basis.

## First Time Setup (Development)
### Server
```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d 
```
This will build the multiple applications (main app, postgres, redis, celery) and launch them. 
```
$ docker-compose exec postgres bash
  # psql -U [user]
  # CREATE DATABASE "[db]"
  # \q
  # exit
```
This loads us into the postgres container and creates the necessary database.
```
$ docker-compose exec app bash
  # flask db upgrade
  # exit
```
Finally, we load into the app container and migrate the database

Go to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to see the app (using the built react app)

### Web
```
$ cd app/web
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
This will install the necessary npm components and start the react app.

If you wish to serve the react app from the server, build it with
```
$ yarn build
```
This is just to serve on production

## Executing Migrations

```
$ docker-compose exec app bash
```
Simply load into the app container and follow the [Flask-Migration Docs](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#example)

*Please note that alembic isn't magic and needs to have certain migrations checked*
